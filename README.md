# Generation-Spend-Analysis

The objective of the project is to create a rank wise illustration of Generations spending corresponding to each category along with a detailed bar plot for the selected category in order to study that which generation spends more in which category. Tableau was used for completing this task. 4 different generations were given i.e., Millennials, Generation X, Baby Boomers and Traditionalists. Different categories of spending were given like hobbies or clothing, furniture, gasoline, groceries etc. Few of many insights I got were like, 18.5% millennials spend in clothing category whereas 105 of baby boomers which shows the highest spending in furniture area. Millennials are even spending a lot in hobbies, gasoline and in restaurants. Traditionalists best spending area were misc, groceries and pharmacies.


Initially data was given (29*9) which includes different columns like End Age, start age, generation, range of year born, % of spending, category and their description. In explaining the steps, initially line chart shows the ranking part of category to % of spending defined by each categories and dual axis was done along with circle chart to provide the desired output. Then the % spending was plotted with different categories for different generations in form of bar chart. Like this, the tableau dashboard was created.
